"Create a stunning, one-page Next.js portfolio site for Prassh that showcases his skills, projects, and unique personality in a visually striking, interactive way. The design should be modern, minimalistic, and mobile-responsive, incorporating smooth animations, transitions, and hover effects. This site should exude professionalism while also feeling approachable and fun.

A clean, full-screen hero section with a background gradient or high-quality image/video.

Display Prassh's name, a short tagline (e.g., "Full-stack Developer | Creative Thinker"), and a smooth-scroll navigation bar linking to sections like About, Skills, Projects, and Contact.

Include a prominent call-to-action button ("Let's Work Together") that smoothly scrolls to the Contact section.

About Section:

A dynamic, engaging bio about Prassh, showcasing his background and experience in a concise yet impactful way.

Display a high-quality circular photo of Prassh alongside a short introduction about his passion for coding, full-stack development, and MERN stack expertise.

Use smooth fade-in effects for text and elements as the user scrolls through this section.

MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)

Tailwind CSS

Display 3â€“5 of Prassh's top projects in a grid layout, each with an image, short description, and tech stack used.

Add hover effects that reveal project details such as the project description, tech stack, and links to live projects or GitHub.

Include a modal or separate page for detailed project information, including screenshot galleries or project demos.

SEO & Performance:

Ensure the site is optimized for SEO and follows best practices for accessibility and fast performance.

Use Next.js features like dynamic imports, lazy loading for images, and server-side rendering (SSR) for better speed and SEO optimization.

Styling:
Use Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, allowing for a responsive and fast-loading design.

Use Shadcn UI components for minimalistic, sleek design consistency across buttons, modals, and other UI elements.

Choose modern fonts from Google Fonts for a professional look.

Stick to an elegant color palette: dark blues, teals, whites, light grays, and accent colors for calls-to-action (like button hover states).

This portfolio should not only highlight Prassh's skills and expertise but also create an enjoyable, smooth user experience, with engaging animations and modern design practices."

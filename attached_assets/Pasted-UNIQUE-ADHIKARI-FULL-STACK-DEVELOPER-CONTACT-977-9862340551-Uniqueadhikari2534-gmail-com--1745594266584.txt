 PROFILE SUMMARY
 Innovative Full Stack Developer with a strong command of modern web
 technologies and a passion for building impactful, user-friendly solutions.
 Experienced in end-to-end development of web and mobile apps, blending
 technical precision with a focus on performance and usability. A proactive
 problem-solver with solid CS fundamentals, strong communication skills, and
 a drive to exceed expectations in fast-paced environments.
 WORK EXPERIENCE
 As a freelance Full Stack Developer, I designed and built full-stack e
commerce platforms (e.g., UANA) using the MERN stack, incorporating
 features such as secure authentication, payment integration (PayPal,
 Khalti), and personalized product recommendations. I developed and
 deployed intelligent chatbot systems connected to product databases,
 enabling human-like interactions and real-time customer support. My
 front-end work involved crafting advanced UI/UX interfaces using
 React, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI, with a strong focus on
 responsiveness, performance, and modern design aesthetics. On the
 backend, I built scalable APIs with Node.js and Express, implementing
 robust middleware for authentication, authorization, and data
 validation.
 I also integrated collaborative filtering and recommendation engines to
 personalize user experiences across applications. My projects include a
 full-featured gift recommendation system, animated product
 carousels, and dynamic chat functionalities tailored to diverse client
 needs. I contributed to a drowsiness detection system using Python
 and OpenCV, demonstrating my ability to work across disciplines.
 Additionally, I led the design and development of multi-role transport
 platforms with Django backends, handling complex workflows and
 real-time operations. Throughout all projects, I managed version
 control using Git and GitHub, ensuring clean, modular, and
 collaborative codebases. My approach always centers on
 understanding client requirements, translating them into effective
 technical solutions, and delivering high-quality results on time
